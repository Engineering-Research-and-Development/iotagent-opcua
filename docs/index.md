The F4I OPC UA Agent is an Open Source component intended to enable capturing data from OPC UA devices on the shopfloor
and provide them to the upper levels of a FIWARE-based system. Therefore, the main focus of this component is on the
communication from field devices implementing an OPC UA server to FIWARE, allowing the communication to the FIWARE Orion
Context Broker.

# Getting Started

As first step we suggest you to follow the instructions available in the
[Tutorial](https://iotagent-opcua.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) section.

In this way you will soon be able to install and run a testbed containing the OPC UA IoTAgent. Then read the "What's
next" section to know how the IoTAgent can be used with your own OPC UA Server
