# timekeeper

## Description

This module mocks `Date` and `Date.now` in order to help you test time-dependent code.
Provides `travel` and `freeze` functionality for your Node.js tests.

## Features/problems

- Please note, that if you are using time freezing, the `setTimeout` and
  `setInteval` won't work as exepcted, since they are using the `Date`
  class but the time will not change until you call `timekeeper#reset`.

## Installation

- NPM: `npm install timekeeper --save`
- Bower: `bower install timekeeper`

## Synopsis

### Freeze:

```js
var tk = require('timekeeper');
var time = new Date(1330688329321);

tk.freeze(time);

// The time hasn't changed at all.

var date = new Date;
var ms = Date.now();

tk.reset(); // Reset.

```

### Travel:

```js
var tk = require('timekeeper');
var time = new Date(1893448800000); // January 1, 2030 00:00:00

tk.travel(time); // Travel to that date.

setTimeout(function() {

	// `time` + ~500 ms.

	var date = new Date;
	var ms = Date.now();

	tk.reset(); // Reset.

}, 500);
```

### Reflection:

```js
var tk = require('timekeeper');
var time = new Date(1893448800000); // January 1, 2030 00:00:00

assertFalse(tk.isKeepingTime());
tk.travel(time);
assertTrue(tk.isKeepingTime());
```
