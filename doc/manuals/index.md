# Welcome to OPC UA Agent.

The F4I IDAS OPC UA Agent is an Open Source component intended to enable capturing data from OPC UA devices on the shopfloor and provide them to the upper levels of a FIWARE-based system. Therefore, the main focus of this component is on the communication from field devices implementing an OPC UA server to FIWARE, allowing the communication to the FIWARE Orion Context Broker.

Github's [README.md](https://github.com/is3labengrd/iotagent-opcua/blob/master/README.md) provides a good documentation summary.
